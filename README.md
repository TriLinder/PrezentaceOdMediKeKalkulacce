# Od mědi ke kalkulačce

## *(From copper to a calculator)*

An interactive presentation

---

## Languages?

This is a presentation I made for school originally in Czech, and I later translated into English.

You can choose between the two languages before starting the presentation, although the speaker notes are only available in Czech.

## What's it about?

The goal of this presentation is to demonstrate how to construct logic gates using simple electronic components and then combine them to create a basic 4-bit adder, while explaining the underlying logic. It also features an interactive simulation of the components. The concept is heavily inspired by [this amazing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZwneRb-zqA) by Sebastian Lague.
